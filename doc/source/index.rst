Automatonymous
==============

Automatonymous is a state machine library for .NET developers. Automatonymous provides a fluent syntax for declaring state machines, including the states, events (both trigger and data events are supported), and state/event activities. While surprising easy to use for simple state machines, Automatonymous has many advanced features that make it usable in a variety of contexts.

Automatonymous is completely open source and licensed under the very permissive Apache 2.0 license, making usable at no cost to anyone for both commercial and non-commercial use.

Automatonymous is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/MassTransit/Automatonymous
